summary: >-
  Amongst the lesser known places of Indian north eastern states is a gem known
  as Nagaland. The picture is of Dzukou Valley on a morning with low lying
  clouds. The night prior was a mesmerizing night of rain, cold winds and then
  sudden clear skies.\

  Dzuou valley is partially in Nagaland and Manipur and naturally there are trekking routes from both the states.
